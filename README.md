> The major objective of the Hotel Management System project was to create java application that allows the hotel manager to manage all hotel operations. This system is very flexible and convenient due to its interactive GUI and the ability to manage various hotel bookings and rooms. It's a very tedious task for a hotel manager to maintain, manage and keep hotel check-ins and checkouts on paper. This application provides him with the capability and flexibility to manage the entire system from a single application. This hotel management project includes storing customer information, allocating and deallocating rooms, managing rooms and customer details, and maintaining records and billing.
